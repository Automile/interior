**Note**<br>
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a dependency, but it's not bundled. Load jQuery of a CDN and hope for a cached copy on the user's machine.

Besides the plugins described below, the Interior js bundle also includes two utility libraries:

- [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript.
- [Tether](http://tether.io/) A client-side library to make absolutely positioned elements attach to elements in the page efficiently.
